When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I want to share my project with other peers. The remote is the way how to achieve this.
Another aspect is safe data storage, I have the remote in case something critical happens to my local macine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to control what is going on in my local sandbox, I do not want to get disturbed with others' changes to the files in my local sandbox. I want to control the point of time, when both repo versions should be merged.
